___Blog Project___

the goal of this project is to create a basic blogging website.

- CRUD: implementing modifiable entries for the blog

- Multiple pages: About me, Home, Blog, Create new entry for Blog

- index.js is what our html page renders

___

We'll Be following an IRL path of sticky notes for our worklog. We will be attempting to avoid:

- Feature Creep

- Adding tasks that our too large to do within a few hours at a time

- "Going down the rabbit hole": jumping from one problem to the next, to the next, to the next, without ever really solving anything

Flex and other styling will mostly be left for later.
